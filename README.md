# Text-based_IR_system
Designing and developing oneâ€™s own text based information retrieval system.
1. Open the file at newInferBuild.py with the 
   code editor of your choice.
2. Change the config variable in it to your 
   MySQL database (it will not be created) and other 
   parameters explained at the start of the file. 
   If the other parameters aren't changed then CMS handouts are indexed.
3. Run newInferBuild.py using "python newInferBuild.py" in terminal/bash.
   This must be run using python 2.7 and not 
   python 3.x and takes about 40 min for the given corpus.
4. Execute the file at newQuery.py using 
   "python newQuery.py" in terminal/bash for querying.
